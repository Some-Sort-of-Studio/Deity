  - characterName: Corvus, Ruler of Corvids
    characterDescription: "During times of ancient war, the march of men and machines
      would ring out a call to the carrion overlord. In the aftermath of a battle\u2019s
      devastation, the flock would come; black velvet corvids would peck and feast
      upon the corpses. These blood-drenched creatures consumed the flesh, upon which
      these errant souls would receive a blessing in their next life.  Corvus would
      judge each soul offered by his servants, with only the true and strong being
      granted passage to rebirth; those judged unworthy were enslaved as corvid,
      cursed to earn redemption.\_  However, the great wars of brutal battle have
      ended, and a long peace stills the pottersfield. Starved of its supply of souls,
      this era of peace has rendered it obsolete. Now powerless, it has been cast
      away to wallow in the darkness."

  - characterName: "\xD8rvatha, Monarch of Trenches  "
    characterDescription: "Back in the day, when the world was big and the maps still
      blank, fearful sailors would pray and give sacrifice to it in hopes of a safe
      journey. Its sheer size and majesty would not go unnoticed by terrified men,
      their flimsy vessels of wood and cloth ignored in return. As to such a being,
      these tiny morsels were insignificant, nary even worth a bite, nor sometimes
      even acknowledgement.\_  It was only as the world became smaller, and boats
      were constructed of metal and steam, did its power fade. Then the words of
      caution and fear were seen as the ramblings of old sea dogs cooked by years
      of sun, scurvy and rum.   As they hunted its food and cared less for its majesty,
      \xD8rvatha starved and shrank and withered. It was as the last of the old breed
      of sailors died, did \xD8rvatha fall from the depths of the dark ocean to a
      depth far worse\u2026  "
