  TomeText: "There is a chill, creeping up my spine, tracing along the bone up to
    my head.\_\n\nIt is fear, I am in here for a reason, I cannot remember it, maybe
    I do not want to.\_\n\nFear for myself or my situation, it evades me.\_\n\nIt
    is dark here, the vision of only my past deeds shines through the glass.\_\n\nA
    tapestry of my own experience, casting through a shadow of my broken body onto
    the floor.\_\n\nI can only write, recollect my thoughts, recount my past."
